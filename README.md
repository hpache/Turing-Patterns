# Turing-Patterns

This github repo contains code that I used to model Turing patterns. In this repo, you will find two directories containing code in Java and Python.

## JavaCode

The JavaCode directory contains java code used to model Turing patterns using cellular automata. The user can find instructions for how to run the code 
in the JavaCode directory along with any potential dependencies. I used two types of cellular automata: continuous cellular automata (CCA), and the
method defined by Weimar in his work, ['Cellular automata for reaction-diffusion systems'](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8191(97)00081-1).

## PythonCode

The PythonCode directory contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks which were used to explore different reaction-diffusion systems. In the notebook,
you will find numerical simulations of the reaction terms for some reaction-diffusion systems, numerical simulations of reaction-diffusion systems using
the py-pde library, and a collection of different gifs showing the simulations.
