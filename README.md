# Turing-Patterns

This is a repo containing a java program designed to model Turing Patterns with java using cellular automata.

In order to run, you need to have java installed on your machine!

## Running the Program

### Running without parameters

1. Compile Simulation.java

``` 
javac Simulation.java
```

2. Execute the Simulation program

```
java Simulation
```

### Running with parameters


1. Compile Simulation.java

``` 
javac Simulation.java
```

2. Execute the Simulation program

```
java Simulation [alpha] [beta] [gamma]
```

## Models

At the moment, the program is only capable of running one model: the BZ reaction model.
